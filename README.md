Sprint one to get done
  - get documents done
  - primitive front end
  - create account and/or log in
  - search products

Xander R - I started working on a login/create user script let me know if you would like to work on it a bit as well and I can put what I have in here. I also created a main php file that will call the functions
    - Create user needs testing but should otherwise be done
    - Main.php will be continually edited to add the new functions but has the create_user function implemented 4/11/24
