SHOPIFY ACCESS:
To get access, click on this link: https://www.shopify.com/pages/shopifypartnersvap?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw8pKxBhD_ARIsAPrG45ntY2xkL_KqDpSxUUionTS2ZA6qqmRbAgKVqr6r7AiX_rHdfwAuYjEaAg-7EALw_wcB.
Then, make an account to become a collaborator. (Just make up a business name).

When you make up the account, on the home page, there should be buttons on the left, including "Stores". Click on that. On that page, there should be an option to send a collaborator request (probably under "Store address"). For the Store URL field, type tinkerbuy.myshopify.com. For the request code, enter 5653. For the requested accesses, just hit everything.
Hit submit. That will send me an email, which I can approve, and then you should (hopefully) have access to everything.

  - I started working on a login/create user script let me know if you would like to work on it a bit as well and I can put what I have in here. I also created a main php file that will call the functions
  - Create user needs testing but should otherwise be done
  - Login script needs testing but should otherwise be done
  - Main.php will be continually edited to add the new functions. Currently has the create_user, item_search and login functions implemented 4/11/24
  - Working on the Edit_User function 4/22/24
