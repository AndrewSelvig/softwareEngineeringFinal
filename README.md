  - I started working on a login/create user script let me know if you would like to work on it a bit as well and I can put what I have in here. I also created a main php file that will call the functions
  - Create user needs testing but should otherwise be done
  - Login script needs testing but should otherwise be done
  - Main.php will be continually edited to add the new functions but has the create_user function implemented 4/11/24
